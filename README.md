# Network-Slicing-for-Reliable-Healthcare
Network slicing aims at improving the quality of service for applications. Smart-health care requires efficient networking capabilities to provide low latency, low loss rate, and high reliability. 
To achieve this we are using multi-class classification model to predict network slice for device or application.
